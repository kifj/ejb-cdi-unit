|Version|Changes|
|-------|-------|
|2.0.30|JaxRSPackagesDeep, fix TransactionServices for ioc-unit-ejb, to allow transactional observers to be tested|
|2.0.29|fix BOM for Wildfly 19|
|2.0.28|compile modules with weld-3.1-SP1, depend on jakarta-apis|
|2.0.27|Introduced BOMs, reorganized Dirs, SutClasses also definable by interface, abstract or annotation, Instance<> will not be resolved, was insconsistent anyway, use SutClass with interface or abstract class, wrapping self-fields only if @Inject or @Ejb|
|2.0.26|fix TestHttpClient to work with WebTarget|
|2.0.25|recognize Testclass in TestScopeExtension also by @Produces, Provide ResteasyClientBuilder|
|2.0.24|ioc-unit-Resteasy: Provide ClientBuilder and WebTarget as availables |
|2.0.23|return Forbidden(403) if not authorized by role|
|2.0.22|fix handling problems and bugs with Resteasy-Auth-Testing|
|2.0.21|added test of authorization to resteasy toolbox|
|2.0.20|integrate dbunit-way to init dbms, TransactionSynchronisationRegistry|
|2.0.19|fixes and tests for validator,  introduced JaxRSClasses to be able to define Rest-Resoirces and Providers explicitly|
|2.0.18|new module ioc-unit-validate, allows it to define Beans (@ValidateClasses) where Validation should be activated during the tests|
|2.0.17|Recognize Restresources even by @Path in interfaces, make jdbcSqlConverter work with XmlAwarePersistenceFactories Eclipselink, Phase4Guesser may not try to resolve Instance-Injects, weld(x)-starter will not bring javaee-api as dependency anymore|
|2.0.16|make jdbcSqlConverter work with XmlAwarePersistenceFactories (persistence.xml) make TestPersistenceFactory final replace it by XmlLess- or XmlAwarePersistenceFactory| 
|2.0.15|jdbcSqlConverter-interface also supported for JPA (hibernate, eclipselink) |
|2.0.14|jdbcSqlConverter-interface allows the replacement of native-statements |
|2.0.13|commons-lang3:3.8.1,enable only Interceptors without Priority automatically|
|2.0.12|@Transactional, XmlLessPersistenceFactory |
|2.0.11|Add generally @Provider-classes defined as Sut or Test to MockDispatcher. --> possible to define ObjectMapper, does also handle @Context in Provider especially: ExceptionMapper |
|2.0.10|reorganized poms, starters depend on the correct javaee-api compiled. If users don't like this, they must exclude it. ioc-unit-xxxx modules depend on the api-modules they need provided, so they don't transitively depend on any javax-api.|
|2.0.9|added javax.json provider from glassfish, include io.rest-assured, if existing allow fluent test of rest-resources using MockDispatcherFactory |
|2.0.8|fix handling of default initial context, transporting the beanmanager|
|2.0.7|ioc-unit-resteasy identifies JaxRS-Restresources and JaxRs-Exception in sutclasses and registers them with Resteasy MockDispatcherFactory. Example, see Test in ioc-unit-resteasy|
|2.0.6|Show Qualifierdiffs at Resource-Injects, if there are; extended TestPersistenceFactory; Improved support of multiple different DataSources and PersistenceContexts so: @PersistenceContext might be necessary to produce it with qualifier similar to @Resource |
|2.0.5|Reverted Qualifiers generated on SessionContext and MessageDrivenContext|
|2.0.4|TestPersistenceFactory can set inital schema, don't use if using Resource SessionContext and MessageDrivenContext|
|2.0.3|fixed Reflections8, changed warnings of analyzer, don't use if using Resource SessionContext and MessageDrivenContext|
|2.0.2|RequestScoped does not need ioc-unit-contexts anymore|
|2.0.1|first ioc-unit-version|
